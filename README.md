# Artattack-GAN 

This project uses a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) to generate artistic human portraits. Trained on a dataset of 4,117 curated art images.

## Features
- Custom DCGAN with Keras subclassed training loop
- 200-epoch training on 64x64 RGB portraits
- Generator & Discriminator visualized and summarized
- Sample outputs from random noise inputs
- Custom loss tracking with plotted learning curves
